Buliding Plans For A Cool Spotlight
I saw these sunset lamps on the internet. They create a round circle of warm coloured light on the wall and are also used in photography. Of course you can just buy one, but then where would the learning and fun be? As you can see you can light up a wall or set an object in scene.

The advantage of making the lamp yourself is that all possible shapes and uses are limitless.



Actually, the trick is to install the led light behind a colour filter and a large lens, or simply dye the lens

So let's get started.

As always, these instructions are just the idea of how to achieve this cool effect. It's how you use it or build it in that makes DIY really interesting.
